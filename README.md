# Banking-fraud-detection-adey
To improve the detection of fraud cases for banking transactions. This project focuses on creating accurate and robust fraud detection models, addressing the specific challenges associated with banking transaction data. It also incorporates techniques like geolocation analysis and transaction pattern recognition to enhance detection accuracy.

# Core Objectives
This project will involve:

# Analyzing and preprocessing transaction data.
Creating and engineering features that help identify fraud patterns.
# Project Structure
The repository is organized into the following directories:

.github/workflows/: Configuration files for GitHub Actions to enable continuous integration (CI) and automated testing.
notebooks/: Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, feature engineering, and preliminary modeling.
scripts/: Python scripts for data preprocessing, feature extraction, and fraud detection model implementation.
tests/: Unit tests to ensure the correctness and robustness of the model and data processing logic.
requirements.txt: Lists dependencies and libraries required for the project setup.
README.md: Main documentation file with an overview of the project, installation instructions, and usage guidelines.
